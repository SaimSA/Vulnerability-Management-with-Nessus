The objective of this lab exercise was to improve my familiarity with Vulnerability Management. I chose Nessus to do this lab because I already had some experience with Nessus during my time at University
and with TryHackme, so I wanted to further my skills on Nessus. The setup featured Nessus Essentials software, VMWare Workstation Player, and a Windows 10 ISO. I followed the Nessus tutorial made by Josh Madakor.


After setting up Nessus Essentials and the Windows 10 VM, I used the "Create a new scan" function in Nessus to begin looking for Vulnerabilites in the VM.
